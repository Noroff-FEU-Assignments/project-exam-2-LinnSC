## Description

This is the final project exam of Front-end development 2nd year. We had two options for this exam, to create a hotel booking site or work with a "real world client".

I chose to work with a real world client. The client is my employer, Jobbkretser AS. <br>
“JK Portalen” is a portal that Jobbkretser are going to build for their Partners. The portal are going to be used to registrate and keep track of existing customers, candidates, and assignments.<br>
This is a larger project that Jobbkretser in the end are going to outsource to a developing team. But for my exam they wanted me to design and build the dashboard and candidate pages.<br>
Because of GDPR and the fact that the API for JK Portalen is not fully ready yet, I created a dummy API. The backend is created with Strapi API.

### Dashboard:
The dashboard is displaying several cards that are going to give usefull information to the Partners once they log in to the portal. The data displayed here are hardcoded for this project, but will later be returned from an API.
<br>

### Candidate pages:
The candidate pages consists of an overview of all candidates, a candidate profile (a candidate spesific page), a create candidate form and an edit candidate form. Both forms are created with Formik and yup validation.


### Login info:
You have to log in to view any of the "JK Portalen" pages.
